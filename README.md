# CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project

Need revisit
Part of the project was completed and need more work on the rest of the project and documentation.

## As a suggestion, the README.md file for each repository can include the following information:
### a list of files contained in the repository with a brief description of each file
1. screenshots (A directory containing generated images)
2. Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html (Generated HTML format for review)
3. Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb (Source code)
4. README.md (Readme file)
5. writeup.md (Writeup file)
 
### any instructions someone might need for running your code
1. Install Open CV
pip install opencv-python
2. Need subdirectory "traffic-signs-data"
3. Need subdirectory "new_images_data"

### an overview of the project
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Specifically, you'll train a model to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

Before submitting, make sure your project covers all of the rubric points, which can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view).

When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload. Alternatively, upload your files to github to link to the project repository:

The Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output.
An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name report.html or report.pdf.
Any additional datasets or images used for the project that are not from the German Traffic Sign Dataset. Please do not include the project data set provided in the traffic-sign-data.zip file.
Your writeup report as a markdown or pdf file
